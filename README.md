Scripts for automated SVRTK reconstruction dockers 
====================

This repository contains the pipelines for [MONAI](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI)-based automated fetal MRI reconstruction [SVRTK dockers](https://hub.docker.com/r/fetalsvrtk/svrtk).



- The repository and code for automation of [SVR](https://github.com/SVRTK/SVRTK) reconstruction were designed and created by [Alena Uus](https://github.com/alenauus).


The auto pipelines are used in:

- Integration via AIDE led by Tom Roberts: https://github.com/SVRTK/aide-svrtk

- Integration via Gadgetron led by Sara Neves Silva: https://github.com/SVRTK/gadgetron-svrtk-integration


Development of SVRTK was supported by projects led by Dr Maria Deprez, Prof Mary Rutherford, Dr Jana Hutter, Dr Lisa Story and Prof Jo Hajnal.
